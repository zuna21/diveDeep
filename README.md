# diveDeep
Program for saving deep web links and search them based on name and category you provided

The program is written in python3, for the gui it uses the Tkinter library.
You can save links and give them a category and name and search based on that.
The program creates two files in the "data" file, one file is "links.txt" which is easier for the user to read, and the second file 
is "data.txt" which serves the program to find the necessary data during the search. You can search for links based on the name and category you provided.
